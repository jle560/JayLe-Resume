        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Jay Le, I am a Vietnamese American born and raised in the Bay Area. Currently, I am enrolled at the University of California Riverside where I am majoring in Pre-Business. My goals for the future are to be admitted into the College of Business and graduate with a Business Administration degree.<br><br>

        Previously in high school, I maintained a cumulative GPA of 3.93. In school, I had a passion for new material. Every year, I took a different elective to find a concentration in a specific field. During freshman year, I took engineering courses where I learned how to model different 3D designs using AutoDesk Inventor. Sophomore year, I took culinary classes to learn the fundamentals of kitchen safety and cooking. Junior year I took what I learned Sophomore year and applied it to a job at our local bakery chain. From Junior year onward, I've been doing work study to make a source of income while maintaining my studies. Senior year I became more fascinated with the idea of entrepreneurship and owning a small business, so I took an AP Economics course and later decided to major in Business Administration. <br><br>

        Outside of school, I worked for Paris Baguette and Fengcha. At the Paris Baguette, I worked as a Sales Associate. There I maintained goods produced and customer service. At the bakery, I quickly learned and became adept with the Toast POS system, where I became efficient at correctly inputting and placing customer's orders. Within my first year at the bakery, I received multiple raises and became a baker to learn a new trade. To uphold our mission statement and values, I showed up to work on time from 5 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. on the weekends while doing school. I worked at Paris Baguette for a year and a half when I found my 2nd job at Fengcha. Fengcha was a brand-new boba shop in my hometown run by a husband-and-wife partnership. Since the store was new, I helped my former employers by organizing work schedules, teaching new employees, and creating a new set of values the store hadn't seen before. Right off the bat, I was the highest-paid employee, later resigning from my job at Paris Baguette dedicating my total time outside of school to work. Taking my previous experience at Paris Baguette into my new job at Fencha, the most challenging part was learning how to manage and operate Doordash and Ubereats. As we had to set up with both companies and connect the services to our printers, setting up both took time to learn. Eventually, I learned how to manage and prioritize the orders both in-store and online, which helped generate more profit for our business. From my experience at the workplace, it has further pushed my goal to own and operate my own small business one day.
